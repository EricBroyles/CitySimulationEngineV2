Unresolved Problems:
* how to have src use multiple folders? (yells at me a lot)
* why is VS still mad at me about function missing for modify_img_update-tex.h  GDCLASS() probably a VS issue idk


Common Issues
* need semi colon at the end of class declarations but not functions :(
* be sure to add the _bind_methods to header and actually inside the .cpp file (whoops) -- error is about _privete or smthng
* be sure to add #pragma once otherwise using namespace godot does not work...


Things to try:
0. Did you save it? AGH
0.1 Restart Godot.
1. Delete the .vs folder in your project directory and restart Visual Studio.
2. Delete the .obj files for each C++ script (hidden by default) in src and gen for the doc_data
3. out/build/.. Might have somthing idk
4. godot_project/bin/windows clear .dll (~ files are locked so close godot and VS and reopen to remove)
5. bin/windows clear .dll

Quirks:
* what a goofy language.
* two ways to instatiate Cell() : x(px), y(px) {} init before constructor runs need for certain constants vs Cell() {x(px), y(px)}
* Constructor Body (Assignment): If you omit the initializer list and assign values inside the constructor body, the members are first default-initialized (or go through their default constructors), and then the values are assigned. This can be less efficient as it involves two operations. 




constructors
destructors
is_valid
setters
getters
stuff
operations



int id() const {return _id} -> const promises not to modify this*, so I can use it on const members (getters that dont modify state should have const)

constexpr Direction(...) constructor means this CAN be used in constexpr memebers and non constexpr members.
cannot have a const constructor but can have a constexpr constructor

you do not repeat the static keyword in the .cpp file when defining a static member function.

when operator+ is a memeber (dont make it a memeber)
operator+
Cell C
Vec v
c + v -> c::operator+ v
v + c -> v::operator+ c 


Cell c;
Cell* p = &c;

this   == p
*this  == c


Circular dependency:
#include Cell in Vec and vice versa, need to forward declare...

Implicit conversion
Cell cell(10, 20);
Vec2i vec = cell;  // Implicit conversion: Cell → Vec2i

Vec2i getPosition() {
    Cell cell(5, 10);
    return cell;  // Implicit conversion: Cell → Vec2i
}

Cell cell(10, 20);
Vec2i vec(5, 5);

Vec2i result = vec + cell;  // cell converts to Vec2i first
// Without conversion operator, this wouldn't compile


MOstly unhelpful error: "rc\register_types.cpp(13): error C2059: syntax error: 'using namespace'" -> likly due to issue in #include of a dependency.


the function(params) const {} const part only refers to "this". with friend it makes the method a non class memebre and their is not a this so cnanot have a const.


ENUMS ----
enum class TT {NONE}
neeed to use TT:: even inside the class. and CLASS::TT:: outside

enum TT {}
do not use TT:: inside and only need CLASS:: to access contents
