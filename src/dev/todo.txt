Test Needed:
* idx.hpp
* get cmid for walk and drive



Features:
+ CM.get_cmid(Cell cell) (done)
+ ParkingManager
+ BuildingManager
+ estimate_walk_time, estime_drive_time

+ Human: Agent
+ PersonalVehicle: Agent
+ Generate initial Parking spaces for Cars and Buildings for Humans.
    -> ParkingManager object lives inside World. assign car to random parking spot. (each car gets its own starting cell). gets passed a car that it assigns stuff to.
    -> BuildingManager object lives inside World. assign person to random building cell. (each person gets their own starting cell). gets passed a Human that it asigns stuff to.
    -> Both work by having different resolutions and by tracking total spaces available at a lower resolution view
    -> have them wrap store a reference to baseworld (cast world to baseworld)

----------------------------
Thursday (2/5/2026):
+ average_walk_speed -> just assume to be 3mph. world.get_average_wlak_speed (Done)
+ average_drive_speed -> (Done)
+ try to use uint8_t* data = img->ptr(); inside matrix to create the matrixes (Done)
+ check all for loops for easy const variable optimization. (Done)
+ Agents: architecture design

-------------------------------
Wednesday (2/4/2026):
+ Tests: rewrite tests that work with new World setup. (Done)
+ Tests for cm should result in a pass/fail output (Done)
+ check for easy performance enhancement, copying too many times. (Done)
- Cleanup code: remove unneeded comments, remove unneeded dependencies. (Done)
+ can_walk_between and can_drive_between (Done)

-------------------------------
Tuesday (2/3/26):
- remove the display from inside the classes matrix and cm. (put inside tester only.)
+ InputPackage
+ add 4 Matrix constructors from tt,tm,dir,mph ImageMatrix<type>

+ fix the matrix so it take in MPH
- depricate old base world & world
- depriacte old cm
+ new base world to take in Input and create Matrix<type>
+ new cm will take in new base world and use matrix
+ new world to take in input package and create the base world and the cm from base_world

+ added mph
- Wrap timing experiments into my_timing_experiments, just make exp2, then have generic tests, call all from tester.
- make BaseWorld use Matrixes instead of ImageMatrix.
- test the speed of CM (currently it is 5799.75 ms)
- depricate ImageMatrix.
- can_walk_between and can_drive_between
- remove BaseWorld data emulators and move into better my_data_emulator class
