Unresolved Problems:
* how to have src use multiple folders? (yells at me a lot)
* why is VS still mad at me about function missing for modify_img_update-tex.h  GDCLASS() probably a VS issue idk


Common Issues
* need semi colon at the end of class declarations but not functions :(
* be sure to add the _bind_methods to header and actually inside the .cpp file (whoops) -- error is about _privete or smthng
* be sure to add #pragma once otherwise using namespace godot does not work...


Things to try:
0. Did you save it? AGH
0.1 Restart Godot.
1. Delete the .vs folder in your project directory and restart Visual Studio.
2. Delete the .obj files for each C++ script (hidden by default) in src and gen for the doc_data
3. out/build/.. Might have somthing idk
4. godot_project/bin/windows clear .dll (~ files are locked so close godot and VS and reopen to remove)
5. bin/windows clear .dll

Quirks:
* what a goofy language.
* two ways to instatiate Cell() : x(px), y(px) {} init before constructor runs need for certain constants vs Cell() {x(px), y(px)}
* Constructor Body (Assignment): If you omit the initializer list and assign values inside the constructor body, the members are first default-initialized (or go through their default constructors), and then the values are assigned. This can be less efficient as it involves two operations.
