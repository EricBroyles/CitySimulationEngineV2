Unresolved Problems:
* how to have src use multiple folders? (yells at me a lot)
* why is VS still mad at me about function missing for modify_img_update-tex.h  GDCLASS() probably a VS issue idk


Common Issues
* need semi colon at the end of class declarations but not functions :(
* be sure to add the _bind_methods to header and actually inside the .cpp file (whoops) -- error is about _privete or smthng


Things to try:
0. Did you save it? AGH
1. Delete the .vs folder in your project directory and restart Visual Studio.
2. Delete the .obj files for each C++ script (hidden by default) in src and gen for the doc_data
3. out/build/.. Might have somthing idk
4. godot_project/bin/windows clear .dll (~ files are locked so close godot and VS and reopen to remove)
5. bin/windows clear .dll
