TT Matrix: R8, uint8 -> val
TM Matrix: R8, uint8 -> val
Direction Matrix: R8, uint8 -> val
Speed Matrix: R8, uint8, sec_pre_step, feet_per_step -> val

Agents:
ID: 4096, RGBA8, int32 -> val
other information packed in 256x256

I want to convert speed, tt, tm, direction into matrix of their respective values.
change ImageMatrix to wrap a Matrix let this handle the conversions

Matrix::create_speed_matrix -> Matrix<Speed> //handle the neccisary checks R8 inputs...






TODO:
* put timing stuff into my_timing and make it more organized. (add a test to explicitly show the time to go Image to Matrix, and Matrix to ImageTexture)
* can walk between and can drive between

BaseWorld Improvements:
* stop using ImageMatrix: reading from godot image is slow
* switch to Matrix<TT>, Matrix<TM>, Matrix<Dir>, Matrix<Speed>. When creating from images use get_data() from the image not a for loop.

CM: currently it is aroun 5.5 seconds
* Baseworld will make it better.
* can reduce the amount of checks by looping over inside, then looping over edges. dont need to check the corners.

Agents:
* I think I still need an image just update from a bitarray.

Agents and Humans and Car. Agents is defined after Human and Car and so cannot see Agents. 


Agents:
* need to allow multiple agents (humans) on the same tile

StepDrawPackage
* each cell in world sized image has an id that points to location in smaller images that are more proportional to the size of the agents
* 65,000 agents 256x256 image. 
* this draw package is gathered by godot and then sent down to sahder to be drawn.
* information needed to draw agents: 2 steps a then and a now to then smoothly move between them.
*   location: infered from location in the world image (dont need to use any bits)
*   orientation: 3 bits
*   type: human or car
*   

location, orientation, human or car, human inside car, car parked, human not moving 
car and human can be on the same tile.
